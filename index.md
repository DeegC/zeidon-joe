### Welcome to Zeidon.
This is the main page for learning about the Zeidon, the Java Object Engine (JOE) and related projects.

### What is Zeidon?
Zeidon is an application framework for developing data-oriented applications.  It enables engineers to design their solutions at a higher level of abstraction to separate the business logic from the underlying storage system.  The abstraction eliminates the the impedance mismatch that occurs between relational DBs and OOP applications.

The abstraction also helps engineers manage the complexity of applications with many tables and relationships.
