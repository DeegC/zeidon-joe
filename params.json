It enables engineers to design their solutions at a higher level of abstraction to separate the business logic from the underlying storage system.  The abstraction eliminates the the impedance mismatch that occurs between relational DBs and OOP applications.\r\n\r\nThe abstraction also helps engineers manage the complexity of applications with many tables and relationships.\r\n\r\n### Additional Documentation\r\nJOE 1.2\r\n[JOE Javadoc](http://deegc.github.io/zeidon-joe/javadoc/1.2/joe/)\r\n[Android for JOE Javadoc](javadoc/1.2/android/)\r\n[Scala for JOE Javadoc](http://deegc.github.io/zeidon-joe/javadoc/1.2/scala/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
