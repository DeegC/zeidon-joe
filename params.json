It enables engineers to design their solutions at a higher level of abstraction to separate the business logic from the underlying storage system.  Zeidon developers use the abstraction to build \"logical objects\" which group multiple entities from the ER model into structures that are given object-oriented traits.  The abstraction also eliminates the impedance mismatch that occurs between relational DBs and OOP applications.\r\n\r\nZeidon does all the work of an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) but it does much more than a traditional ORM.
