Additionally, remember that at larger schools faculty members rarely, if ever, take the time to meet with prospective students, let alone attempt to make phone contact.

Do not underestimate this aspect of your involvement in building a class.  \r\nRemember, one of the things we market is our size and what that size means to the development of relationships, community, and employment networking.  Additionally, remember that at larger schools faculty members rarely, if ever, take the time to meet with prospective students, let alone attempt to make phone contact.  Phone contact really does mean something.\r\n\r\nSecond, you are trying to get a feel for whether or not the prospect is looking for program INFORMATION and graduate outcomes - or for CONNECTION.  \r\n\r\nYou know better than anyone else about what your program has to offer.  That will cover the INFORMATION piece.  It would be good to have an example or two of what some of your recent graduates are doing.  \r\n\r\nAs for CONNECTION, below you will find a list of open-ended questions that can aid you in establishing a relationship.  Of course, these are just suggestions.
