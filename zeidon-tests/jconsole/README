This is a sample project is used to start jconsole with the Zeidon plugin.  Maven is used
to build the classpath for calling jconsole.  The zeidon-test project needs
to be included in the classpath so the Zeidon plugin knows where to find
the ZENCAs meta files (e.g. the XODs).  Requires JAVA_HOME be set to find the
jconsole runtime files.

Update log4j.xml if you want to see debug messages.  This will open the jconsole
"console" window.
