1.4.0
    - View.scala is no longer a case class because it is mutable.
    - Added pagination.
    - Swapped date and datetime domains; date now extends datetime.  May require app
      changes to DB translators.
    - Removed ini4j and replaced it with Apache Commons configuration.  JOE should now
      be 1.8 compatible.  This currently makes zeidon.ini keys case-sensitive.
    - Added addToAttribute with a context.  Used only by dates so far.
    - Added Maven enforcer to enforce that jar versions are common across
      dependencies.
    - Updated commons-validator from 1.4.1 -> 1.5.0
    - Added convenience method view.root() to return the cursor for the root entity.
    - Added convenience implicit method .unpickle() to automatically return a Scala view
      when deserializing.
    - Added Base64BlobDomain for blobs that can be (de)serialized to strings.

1.0.7
    - Renamed ViewOd, ViewEntity, and ViewAttribute to LodDef, EntityDef, and 
      AttributeDef.

      child entities from the same table in a single select statement.
    - Renamed oiServerUrl to oiSourceUrl in zeidon.ini.
    - ObjectEngine.createTask( appName ) now creates a NON-persistent task.
      ObjectEngine.createTask( appName, taskId ) still creates persistent tasks.
    - Following options added to Activation qualification:
        - Exclude processing--entities can be excluded from being loaded.
	- Activate Limit.
	- Lazy load can be ignored--all entities will be automatically loaded.
    - Added Boolean as one of the supported Zeidon types.
    - Fixed bug that loaded child entities with a join even if they were qualified
      with a RESTRICTING.
    - Added functionality for creating Dynamic View Attributes.
    - Removed some uses of ThreadLocalStorage.
    - Restricted delete if child entities were loaded with qualification.
    - Added ability to specify multiple Java Edit Formats for parsing date strings.
      To use, specify multiple formats seperated by a '|' in the domain context.
    - Fixes to pessimistic locking.
    - Update to Object Browser to run in a single window.
    - Added some JMX debugging.
    - Added jconsole plugin to run Object Browser.
